## Jimmy Lyons

I have been working in London as a Structural Engineer since graduating from univeristy in 2015. Having reached several personal milestones in that career, I have taken the decision to carve a new path for myself in tech, where I am confident that my methodical and technical approach to problem solving will find a natural home.

## Work Experience

**Heyne Tillett Steel** (April 2019 to April 2022)

- Same tasks as at Elliott Wood plus those listed below:
- Indipendently running engineering projects from conception to construction.
- Managing workload across serveral projects simultaneously.
- Delegating work packages to team members with clear goals, methodolgy and timelines and providing support as required.
- Mentoring junior engineers.
- Attending and running project meetings. 
- Managing project finances against resources.

**Elliott Wood** (August 2015 to November 2018)  
_Structural Engineer_

- Complex analysis and calculation processes to design structural elements.
- Manipulation and rationalisation of large amounts of analytical data into a useable format.
- Working on discrete calculation or design packages to feed into the wider project.
- Collaboration with numerous and diverse disciplines external to my company to deliver my projects.
- Developing automated calculations to streamline project work.

## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.
(Using a STAR example Paragraph) Consider the questions below.

-STAR
-What was the situation/task? (ST)

-How was the skill used?

-What did you do? (action)

-What was the result?


#### This Skill

- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence (STAR)

#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed (again use STAR for this)

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

## Education

#### Makers Academy (April 2022 to July 2022)
- Use short descriptions of what you did and a skill you used. (Similar to format from the 'Work Experience' section above)
- e.g Frequently used paring in order to problemsolve effeciently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- you might also mention aspects some other skills/knowledge listed below: 
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### University of Leeds (September 2011 to June 2015)

- Architectural Engineering (MEng)
- 2:1
- While the degree ultimately qualified us for the discipline of structural engineering, it was taught through the lense of collaboration and integration
  between different bodies: structural engineering, architecture, building services engineering and practical construction. The ability to view a 
  problem hollistically, through the perspective of multiple disciplines, is something that I've applied successfully throughout my career to date. 

#### Any other qualifications

Chartetership with the Institute of Structural Engineers (MIStructE) - 2021. 
Obtaining professional chartership with the IStructE requires a portfolio submission, technical interview with two members and passing an eigth hour exam.
This qualification is the culmination of hundreds of hours of work across numerous evenings and weekends ontop of the hours I spent at my job. 
As well as being a personal milestone, I believe it is indicative of my hard work ethic and dedication.

## Hobbies

Cooking, travelling, live music, football, climbing, film, tv, walking, socialising. Most of these took a serious hit during covid!
