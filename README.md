## Jimmy Lyons

I have been working in London as a Structural Engineer since graduating from univeristy in 2015. Having reached several personal milestones in that career, I have taken the decision to carve a new path for myself in tech, where I am confident that my methodical and technical approach to problem solving will find a natural home.
